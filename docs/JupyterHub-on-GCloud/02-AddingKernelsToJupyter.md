# Introduction

This document aims to teach how to install additional kernels in JupyterHub. A kernel, in this
context, is a program that runs and introspects the user’s code. JupyterHub uses kernels to run
and support different programming languages. This guide was tested on a deployment of ‘The
littlest JupyterHub’ running on Ubuntu 18 inside of a VirtualBox.
#### Note: ​I had to manually grant write permission to users to install using conda.

## R Kernel
1. Login to JupyterHub as an admin user, and run a terminal.
2. Run the command:
>sudo -E conda install r
3. After the installation is done, run r with the command: R
4. Install needed R packages with:
>install.packages(c(​'repr'​, ​'IRdisplay'​, ​'IRkernel'​), type = ​'source'​)
5. Make the R kernel available to all JupyterHub users:
>IRkernel::installspec(user = ​FALSE​)
6. Installation is done, R notebooks should now be supported.

## Octave Kernel
1. Login to JupyterHub as an admin user, and run a terminal.
2. Install Octave with conda:
>sudo conda install octave

- If the above doesn't work, run:
>conda install octave

3. Install the Octave Kernel with conda:
> conda config --add channels conda-forge <br>
 conda install octave_kernel

4. Installation should be done, Octave notebooks should now be supported.
