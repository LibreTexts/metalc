## Load Balancer
A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications. They improve the overall performance of applications by decreasing the burden on servers associated with managing and maintaining application and network sessions, as well as by performing application-specific tasks.

## SSL termination
A TLS termination proxy (or SSL termination proxy[1]) is a proxy server that is used by an institution to handle incoming TLS connections, decrypting the TLS and passing on the unencrypted request to the institution's other servers (it is assumed that the institution's own network is secure so the user's session data does not need to be encrypted on that part of the link). TLS termination proxies are used to reduce the [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing) on the main servers by offloading the cryptographic processing to another machine, and to support servers that do not support SSL, like [Varnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish_(software).
