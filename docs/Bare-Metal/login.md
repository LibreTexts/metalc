## Getting started with Jupyter
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html) is an environment where you can
create interactive notebooks with code, visualizations, and more. 

Some resources to learn Jupyter:
* [jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try) has interactive demo notebooks in
many different languages
* [Demo video of Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLWBfR2hxoo&list=PLUrHeD2K9CmnCOjrnHzSIbZbZmDE-lQRt)
of how to navigate the Jupyter Notebook.
* Visit the 
[JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/interface.html)
for more information on navigating the interface.

## Setting up custom conda environments
Please visit [here](https://github.com/LibreTexts/default-env#creating-your-own-custom-conda-environment)
for information on creating custom conda environments.

## Setting up custom environments for a class
If you are a teacher who wants to set up an environment with custom packages and kernels,
please create a Dockerfile. There are two ways to do this:
1. Use [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert a repository
to a Docker image.
1. Use or build on top of a [Jupyter Docker Stack](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
already available to the community.

Please upload your Dockerfile to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/). Email the Docker image and tag name to
<email> to add it to the spawner page.
