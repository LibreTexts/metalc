# RAID

Redundant Array of Independent Disks.

**Why?**



1. For **speed of operation**, you want to minimize the access time.
1. For **data redundancy**, if any one drive fails you want to be able to continue operating without loss of data. [Guide to RAID for Dummies](https://tierradatarecovery.co.uk/dummies-guide-to-raid/)) 

**Keywords**

* Parity - extra info that can be used to recreate the data, if it's lost
* Striping - splitting up data into different disks
* Stripe size - amount of data being read or written, to and from the disk at a time

**RAID0** has striping, but no redundancy (doesn't have mirroring or parity).



*   It's fast because the data is split up into two hard drives.
*   If the drive fails, then you lose the data. (no redundancy)

**RAID1** has data mirroring, but no striping or parity. It's meant to back up data.

*   Data is written to both drives.
*   If one drive fails, then you still have a backup.

**RAID5** has block level striping with distributed parity. It's used primarily for redundancy, with some speed.

*   Needs 3 drives, minimum
*   Data is striped across the hard drives (like RAID0)
*   Stores some extra data so it knows how to reconstruct it if a drive fails

**RAID6** has two parity stripes on each 'row'. Seems to be primarily for data redundancy.

*   Needs 4 drives, minimum
*   If both drives fails, then you can still recover your data.
